# This decorator returns a new view function that wraps the original view it’s applied to.
# The new function checks if a user is loaded and redirects to the login page otherwise.
# If a user is loaded the original view is called and continues normally.
# You’ll use this decorator when writing the blog views.

# --- Endpoints and URLs
# The url_for() function generates the URL to a view based on a name and arguments.
# The name associated with a view is also called the endpoint,
# and by default it’s the same as the name of the view function.
# For example, the hello() view that was added to the app factory earlier in the tutorial has the name 'hello'
# and can be linked to with url_for('hello').
# If it took an argument, which you’ll see later, it would be linked to using url_for('hello', who='World').
# When using a blueprint, the name of the blueprint is prepended to the name of the function,
# so the endpoint for the login function you wrote above is 'auth.login' because you added it to the 'auth' blueprint.
